							Even tough the planet is so close to the sun, in 2012, The MESSENGER spacecraft discoverd water ice in one of the craters near its north pole.<br /> <br />
							Mercury is constantly shrinking as the planet is made up of a single conitinental plate over a cooling iron core. as the core cools and solidifies, the planets volume shrinks<br /><br />
							Mercury is also the second densest planet due to its huge metalic core.

							The planet has the hotest surface in all the solar system. 
							Temperatures can reach up to 465 degrees Celsius, its dense atmosphere traps in heat like a greenhouse.<br /><br />
							Venus and Earth are sometimes called twins because they are similar, mass, density and gravity however the similarites end there.<br /><br />
							Venus does not have any moons.

						<div class="Title"><br /> Significant Information </div>
						<div class="Content">
								Venus has a hellish atmosphere as well, consisting mainly of carbon dioxide with clouds of sulfuric acid, and scientists have only detected trace amounts of water in the atmosphere. 
								The atmosphere is heavier than that of any other planet, leading to a surface pressure 90 times that of Earth.<br /><br />
								The surface of Venus is extremely dry. During its evolution, ultraviolet rays from the sun evaporated water quickly, keeping it in a prolonged molten state.
								There is not more water left today due to the heat boiling any water away.<br /><br />
								Six mountainous regions make up about one-third of the Venusian surface. One mountain range, called Maxwell, is about 540 miles (870 km) long and reaches up to some 7 miles (11.3 km) high, making it the highest feature on the planet.

							Earth is the third farthest planet from the sun, its the only planet known to have an atmosphere containing free oxygen, oceans of liquid water on its surface, and life. <br /><br />
							Earth is the only planet not name after a Greek/Roman God. 
							The name Earth is an English/German name which simply means "The ground".<br /><br />
							Earth is the fifth largest planet in the solor system, smaller than all the gass planets, but bigger than the other rocky planets.<br /><br />

						<div class="Title"><br /> Significant Information </div>
						<div class="Content">

							Earth has a diameter of roughly 8,000 miles (13,000 kilometers), and is round because gravity pulls matter into a ball, although it is not perfectly round, instead being more of an "oblate spheroid".<br /><br />
							Roughly 71 percent of Earth's surface is covered by water, most of it in the oceans. About a fifth of Earth's atmosphereis made up of oxygen, produced by plants

							Aqua is a major international Earth Science satellite mission centered at NASA. Launched on May 4, 2002, the satellite has six differrent Earth-observing instruments on board and is named for the large amount of information it collects about water in the Earth system.<br /><br />
							Aura's four instruments study the atmosphere's chemistry and dynamics. Aura's measurements enable us to investigate questions about ozone trends, air-quality changes and their linkage to climate change.<br /><br />
							The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) spacecraft is a joint U.S. (NASA) / French (Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales/CNES) mission. Observations from spaceborne lidar, combined with passive imagery, will lead to improved understanding of the role aerosols and clouds play in regulating the Earth’s climate, in particular, how aerosols and clouds interact with one another.
