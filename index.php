							Even tough the planet is so close to the sun, in 2012, The MESSENGER spacecraft discoverd water ice in one of the craters near its north pole.<br /> <br />
							Mercury is constantly shrinking as the planet is made up of a single conitinental plate over a cooling iron core. as the core cools and solidifies, the planets volume shrinks<br /><br />
							Mercury is also the second densest planet due to its huge metalic core.
